    <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tortillas:</strong> First, you’ve got to decide if you’re going with soft shells or hard taco shells. I’m a soft corn tortilla guy myself, given the texture, flavor and ability to prepare them according to your personal preference. Whether you’re using corn tortillas or flour tortillas, make sure you heat them up in a dry skillet first so they don’t break on you. Dumping the contents of your perfect taco all over your plate before you even take a bit is the worst!</li>
            <li><strong>Proteins:</strong> When you’re picking your protein, double-check the cooking time. Ingredients like pork shoulder or chicken thighs will take longer than steak (though check your marinating times!), ground beef, ground chicken or fish taco recipes. So, make sure you’re allowing the right amount of time to cook your delicious taco filling.</li>
            <li><strong>Toppings:</strong>Here’s where your imagination can run wild. Refried beans, sour cream, pico de gallo, cotija cheese, diced red onion, fresh cilantro, avocado — the list goes on. Don’t forget the lime wedges and your favorite FYR hot sauce!</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong>For homemade taco seasoning, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder and ground cumin are great to have on hand, plus chiles to kick up the heat a notch.</li>
        </ul>
