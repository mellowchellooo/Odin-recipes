      <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Cinnamon sugar</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The first step is to form the base of the dough. Let the butter mixture come to a rolling boil before adding the flour and salt. Vigorously stir until the flour is fully combined with the butter into a dough, then continue stirring to let the carryover heat shape that dough into a cohesive ball. This motion helps develop the gluten in the dough, which is crucial in making a soft but pipeable churro batter.</li>
        <li>Using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer, beat each egg fully into the dough before adding the next one; this will help aerate the dough and whip structure into the final batter. The best part is that you can do this right in the pot, no need to get out an extra bowl. The end result should be smooth and fluffy and pale golden.</li>
        <li>Time to get frying. Make sure the oil is at 375° with an instant-read or deep-fry thermometer. Using a piping bag and large star tip, start squeezing the dough into the oil into pieces about 6" long. Cut off with kitchen shears to separate. Fry until cooked through and golden brown, which should take about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Using a spider or slotted spoon, remove the fried churros from the pot.</li>
        <li>And dunk immediately into cinnamon sugar, turning them around to coat so the cinnamon sugar adheres.</li>
        <li>To make the sauce, simply pour some simmering cream over the chips to melt, add a little cinnamon and salt, and it's ready to go.</li>
      </ol>
